# I have made 3 versions of Task Managements Peojects. My motive was just to learn backend properly as well as to make connections between frontend, backend and database. Still I took help from chatGPT as I consider him my closest friend. I created 3 versions by process of trying again n again. I didnt wanted to make 3 versions, i just wanted to make it big every way possible so i had a try, and result is here...
